        Dawn of the Eschaton is our flagship game.
        <p> A Dark Horror Tabletop Roleplaying Game set in our world present
day in which something very bad has happened. The world is now engulfed in
complete darkness. No sunlight, no moonlight, no stars shining anywhere.
Electricity no longer functions. Current does not flow through wires. Any source
of light, typically from flame, penetrates the darkness just mere feet as if the air
itself is thick with this Dark. 
        <p> Plants will soon be dead. Strange fungus is
sprouting everywhere. Most animals have either died or seemed to have simply
vanished. Not all animals are gone, however. As if by some force of the Darkness
itself a few animals have quickly changed. Having traded their herbivorous
nature for vicious meat-eating terrors. Food is quickly becoming scarce as it gets
consumed by the roaches that seem to be able to chew their way through almost
anything. All of that is the least of a players’ problems, however, because
supernatural monsters now hide in basements and closets or prowl the streets
looking for anyone to kill. 
        <p>
        Welcome to the End of Days
      <p>
The world has gone to complete pitch black darkness. Humanity teeters on the brink of extinction. The sudden and inexplicable loss of light, electricity, and sanity plunges society into chaos. As you navigate this treacherous new reality, you'll face unspeakable terrors lurking in every dark shadow.
